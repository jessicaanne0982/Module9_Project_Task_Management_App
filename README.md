# Household Task Management Application

The Household Task Management Application builds upon my understanding of HTML5 and incorporates practice using Bootstrap 5 to create responsive webpages.  This mock home management application named CleanSlate, allows a user to create an account to manage all tasks related to their household. Elements utilized in this application are forms, cards, carousels, accordions, and badges.

- The Home/Landing Page showcases a carousel of clean home images and cards describing what the benefits of the CleanSlate application are.
- The Dashboard page displays an accordion with each of the task categories and a short description of that category.  It also shows a table of the tasks a user has created and when the deadlines are.  Finally, links to edit, delete, or create a new task are available.
